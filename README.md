# Evil Russian

**The goal**: _make usual VIM actions (nagivation, changing modes, etc.) available
for Russian keyboard layout_.

I'm writing lots of TeX in Russian and being forced to constantly switch layouts
to make any simple action really slows me down... and drives crazy. It doesn't
really matter much whether I'm pressing "k" or "Ð»" -- it's the same key on the
keyboard.

So, this is going to be a small spacemacs layer (or a standalone package, we'll
see) that will make Evil talk Russian.
